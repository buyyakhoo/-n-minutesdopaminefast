# **(n)minutesdopaminefast**
- (n)minutesdopaminefast  is a side project designed to encourage users to take a breaks from the cycle of infinite scrolling on digital platforms. 
- It focuses on helping individuals disconnect from the addictive patterns of endless content consumption and gives them a structured approach to pause and reset.
- This side project is inspired by the website [1minutedopaminefast.com](https://1minutedopaminefast.com/), and I've created it to add a feature that allows users to input a custom number of minutes to set their dopamine fast duration.
